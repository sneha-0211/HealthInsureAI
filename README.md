# Health Insurance Premium Prediction

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** that predicts **health insurance premiums** based on personal and health-related attributes. The project is implemented in **Python** using a Jupyter Notebook (`HEALTH_INSURANCE.ipynb`).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and build ML models that can **predict insurance charges**. This helps insurance companies with:  
- 📊 Risk assessment  
- 💰 Pricing strategies  
- 🧑‍⚕️ Personalized insurance plans  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✅ Feature Engineering  
- ✅ Model Training (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- ✅ Model Evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)  
- ✅ Visualization of insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-insurance-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the folder
 ```bash
   cd health-insurance-prediction
```


3. Open the notebook
 ```bash
   jupyter notebook HEALTH_INSURANCE.ipynb
```

## Results

The models successfully predict insurance premiums with reasonable accuracy.
Random Forest achieved the best performance among tested models.
